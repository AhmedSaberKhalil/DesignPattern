# DesignPattern
### What are Design Patterns?
###### Design Patterns are nothing but, you can say, documented and tested solutions for recurring problems in a given context.
###### So, in simple words, we can say that Design Patterns are reusable solutions to the problems that, as a developer,
###### we encounter in our day-to-day programming. Design Patterns are used to solve the problems of Object Generation and Integration.
